I am a Threat Hunter with a passion for digging deep into logs and exploring raw data. My favorite tools are Kusto, Kibana, MISP, and WSL2.
Outside of work, I love participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, mixing up new cocktail recipes, and spending my free time outdoorsâ€”whether mountain biking in the summer or snowboarding in the winter.

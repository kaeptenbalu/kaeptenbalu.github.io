I’m a Threat Hunter who loves digging into logs and exploring raw data. My go-to tools are Kusto, Kibana, MISP, and WSL2.
I also work as a freelancer, offering consulting in Threat Hunting and Image Forensics. I have experience with DAX companies, medium-sized businesses, and small businesses, providing customized solutions to fit their needs.

Outside of work, I enjoy participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, trying out new cocktail recipes, and spending time outdoors—whether it’s mountain biking in the summer or snowboarding in the winter.
